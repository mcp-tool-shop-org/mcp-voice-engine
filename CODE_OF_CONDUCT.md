# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, or religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
