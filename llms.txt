# MCP Voice Engine

> Deterministic, streaming-first prosody engine for expressive voice synthesis and real-time voice transformation

## Overview

MCP Voice Engine is a DSP engine for pitch control, prosody shaping, and voice transformation. It is streaming-first (causal, no retroactive edits), deterministic (same input + config = same output), and designed for real-time applications. It powers the mcp-voice-soundboard.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/mcp-voice-engine.git
cd mcp-voice-engine
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Core Capabilities

- **Deterministic output** — Same input + config produces identical output, verified by hash-based regression tests
- **Streaming-first runtime** — Stateful, causal processing for low latency; supports snapshot/restore for persistence
- **Expressive prosody controls** — Event-driven accents and boundary tones for cadence and intonation shaping
- **Meaning tests** — Semantic guardrails enforcing accent locality, question vs statement boundaries, post-focus compression, deterministic event ordering

## Repository Structure

```
packages/voice-engine-dsp/    Core DSP + streaming prosody engine, tests, benchmarks
packages/voice-engine-dsp/docs/    Architecture, meaning contract, debugging guide, reference
```

## Test Commands

```
npm test                  # Full suite
npm run test:meaning      # Semantic guardrail tests
npm run test:determinism  # Reproducibility tests
npm run bench:rtf         # Real-time factor benchmark
npm run smoke             # Quick smoke test
```

## Constraints

- Node.js / TypeScript
- Causal processing only — no retroactive edits to already-emitted samples
- Determinism guarantee holds only when chunking policy is identical
- Style monotonicity invariant: expressive > neutral > flat (without increasing instability)
